Big light
Replace fuse holder with a switch
Pi connectors - what is an isn't acceptable
pull up resistors for stepper enable (how does this work)


TO FIX:
Check all power traces (they are too small)
Pi connector - recommended using a full 40pin ribbon cable an connect some Pi's gpio to the msp
Find test points better homes (not all GND at one end)

FIXED:
- Added pullup resistors to stepper enable [FUN through-hole 10k]
- Replaced all 0.01uF capacitors [FUN? through-hole]
- Replaced MUX/DEMUX
