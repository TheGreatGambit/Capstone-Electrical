Big light
Replace fuse holder with a switch
Pi connectors - what is an isn't acceptable
pull up resistors for stepper enable (how does this work)


TO FIX:
Check all power traces (they are too small)
Replace fuse with switch?
Pi connector - recommended using a full 40pin ribbon cable an connect some Pi's gpio to the msp
Add a connector + cirucitry for the big light (nmos)
pull up resistors for stepper enable (how does this work)
Space out traces
Find test points better homes (not all GND at one end)
Use more through hole? 
Update DRC to use much larger clearances
expand the pads on the inductors 
Make board larger
